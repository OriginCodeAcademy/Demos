## Authentication vs Authorization

### Authentication

Authentication is the identification of a user. Turning that random set of numbers we call an IP address into an authentic user.

### Authorization

Authorization is giving users the ability to perform certain actions once they are authenticated.

Bob authenticates himself with the payroll application. He has an administrative role and is authorized to perform any action.
